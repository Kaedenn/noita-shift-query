What are the fungal shifts for this seed? Which shifts will use a flask? What's the Alchemic Precursor recipe? What's the Lively Concoction recipe?

This mod will tell you exactly these. It lists all pending shifts (configurable) using either the internal material name or your localized name (also configurable).

If a shift mentions using a flask, then a flask or pouch will be used, assuming you're holding one. If a flask isn't mentioned, then the shift won't use one.

This mod requires Noita-Dear-ImGui, which requires unsafe mods to be enabled. Download that here: https://github.com/dextercd/Noita-Dear-ImGui/releases

This mod benefits tremendously from GrahamBurger's wonderful Less Inaccuracies mod. Download that here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963870452

** Features **

* Accurate flask/pouch indication: if a shift mentions a flask, then a flask or pouch will be used, assuming you're holding one with something in it.
* Option to display a limited subset of shifts (all, previous, current, next, next two, etc).
* Option to display greedy shifts (successful greedy shifts are always displayed) (see "Greedy Shifts" below).
* Option to display either all or the primary shift material for multi-material shifts.
* Option to enable or disable Alchemic Precursor and Lively Concoction recipes (see "Alchemic Precursor and Lively Concoction" below).
* Option to show you exactly what materials have been shifted.
* Option to show a material's internal name, localized name, or both. Note that localized names change with fungal shifts (this is how fungal shifts work) so be careful if you pick that option.
* Live feedback for shift grace period between consecutive shifts.

** Greedy Shifts **

Attempting to shift a material to gold or Holy Grass only has a 0.1% (1/1000) chance of succeeding. Most of the time you'll get one of the "greedy" materials. Successful greedy shifts are always displayed and this shift can be used to obtain large amounts of gold or Holy Grass.

The greedy materials are: brass, silver, toxic sludge, pea soup, flammable gas, poo, mammi, toxic meat, and vomit. Most of the time, attempting to shift a material to gold or Holy Grass will instead shift it to one of these.

** Alchemic Precursor and Lively Concoction **

These recipes are randomly generated every seed and take three random materials to generate Alchemic Precursor or Lively Concoction. The behavior is as follows:
Material_2, in the presence of Material_1 and Material_3, has a N percent chance to become Alchemic Precursor or Lively Concoction. Therefore, you want a large amount of the second material and a small amount of the first and third materials. A higher conversion percentage results in a more efficient conversion.

For example, the Alchemic Precursor recipe of "mud, water, oil" will convert large quantities of water to Alchemic Precursor in the presence of both mud and oil.

** Note on Failed Shifts **

If you see the message "shift_query - shift <number> failed outright", then *please* send me a message with your seed number. Mathematically speaking this message should be practically impossible, but I don't have the patience to determine that probability.

Feedback welcome!
