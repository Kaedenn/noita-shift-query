What are the fungal shifts for this seed? Which shifts will use a flask? What's the Alchemic Precursor recipe? What's the Lively Concoction recipe?

This mod will tell you exactly these. It lists all pending shifts (configurable) using either the internal material name or the localized name (also configurable).

If a shift mentions using a flask, then a flask or pouch will be used, assuming you're holding one. If a flask isn't mentioned, then the shift won't use one.

This mod requires Noita-Dear-ImGui, which requires unsafe mods to be enabled. Download that here: https://github.com/dextercd/Noita-Dear-ImGui/releases

This mod benefits tremendously from GrahamBurger's wonderful Less Inaccuracies mod. Download that here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963870452

Feedback and suggestions welcome! Please give this mod a thumbs up if you enjoy it; this helps the mod reach more people!

** Features **

* Accurate flask/pouch indication: if a shift mentions a flask, then a flask or pouch will be used, assuming you're holding one with something in it.
* Failed shift feedback and resolving (see "Failed Shifts" below).
* Material icons! A small box is displayed next to each material with the material's texture. This can be disabled in both the mod settings and Display menu.
* Colors! The display is made colorful to aid reading. This can be disabled in both the mod settings and Display menu.
* Options to display a limited subset of shifts (all, previous, next, next two, etc).
* Accurate material names and icons: shifting a material will not change the list of shifts. This makes using localized/translated material names viable.
* Option to display greedy shifts (successful greedy shifts are always displayed) (see "Greedy Shifts" below).
* Option to display either all or the primary shift material for multi-material shifts.
* Option to enable or disable Alchemic Precursor and Lively Concoction recipes (see "Alchemic Precursor and Lively Concoction" below).
* Option to show you exactly what materials have been shifted. This is referred to as the Shift Log in the Display menu.
* Option to show a material's internal name, localized name, or both. Localized names no longer change with fungal shifts.
* Live feedback for shift grace period between consecutive shifts.
* "Terse mode", which makes messages shorter.

** Failed Shifts **

Shifts can have the same material for both the source and destination. When this occurs, Noita regenerates the shift. This mod will tell you if this happens and what the regenerated shift is.

For instance, on seed 1833579957, the second shift is flask or acid to acid. If not holding a flask or holding a flask of acid, the shift will instead be flammable gas to flask or toxic sludge. Holding a material other than acid will convert that material to acid. Holding a flask of acid will convert flammable gas to acid. Not holding any flask or pouch will convert flammable gas to toxic sludge.

Please note that if you see the message "shift_query - shift <number> failed outright", then *please* send me a message with your seed number. Mathematically speaking this message should be practically impossible, but I don't have the patience to determine that probability.

** Greedy Shifts **

Attempting to shift a material to gold or Holy Grass only has a 0.1% (1/1000) chance of succeeding. Most of the time you'll get one of the "greedy" materials. Successful greedy shifts are always displayed and this shift can be used to obtain large amounts of gold or Holy Grass.

The greedy materials are: brass, silver, toxic sludge, pea soup, flammable gas, poo, mammi, toxic meat, and vomit. Most of the time, attempting to shift a material to gold or Holy Grass will instead shift it to one of these.

** Alchemic Precursor and Lively Concoction **

These recipes are randomly generated every seed and take three random materials to generate Alchemic Precursor or Lively Concoction. The behavior is as follows:
Material_2, in the presence of Material_1 and Material_3, has a N percent chance to become Alchemic Precursor or Lively Concoction. Therefore, you want a large amount of the second material and a small amount of the first and third materials. A higher conversion percentage results in a more efficient conversion.

For example, the Alchemic Precursor recipe of "mud, water, oil" will convert large quantities of water to Alchemic Precursor in the presence of both mud and oil.
